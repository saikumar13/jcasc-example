Slide 3: CI/CD in Agile ‚Äì Foundation, Practice, and Reality

üîÅ DevOps & Agile ‚Äì Which Comes First?

‚Ä¢	Agile defines the mindset and workflow: iterative, feedback-driven, customer-focused

‚Ä¢	DevOps puts that mindset into action: automation, integration, rapid delivery

‚Ä¢	CI/CD is the operational bridge ‚Äî DevOps practices enabling Agile promises

Takeaway: Agile sets the goals, DevOps executes them, and CI/CD is the delivery engine

üéØ CI/CD Objectives in Agile Context:

‚Ä¢	Deliver value quickly and safely through automation

‚Ä¢	Minimize manual errors and deployment delays

‚Ä¢	Integrate security and quality as early as possible (shift left)

‚Ä¢	Ensure traceability and reproducibility for every change

‚Ä¢	Enable continuous feedback loops across Dev, QA, and Ops

 

üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used Across the Pipeline:

‚Ä¢	Source Control: GitHub / GitLab

‚Ä¢	CI Engine: Jenkins, GitHub Actions

‚Ä¢	Quality Gate: SonarQube

‚Ä¢	Security: BlackDuck, TruffleHog

‚Ä¢	Build Tools: Maven, npm (as applicable)

‚Ä¢	Deployment: Helm, ArgoCD, Kubernetes

‚Ä¢	Artifact Storage: Nexus, S3, or Git tags

 

‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Strategy in Our Project:

‚Ä¢	CI pipeline with standard stages (checkout, build, test, scan)

‚Ä¢	Dedicated CI stages for:

o	Fetching environment-specific configs from separate Git repo

o	Tagging configs per release and aligning with chart version

‚Ä¢	ArgoCD (multi-source mode) fetches:

o	App chart from app repo

o	YAML values from config repo per environment

‚Ä¢	Controlled rollout with optional manual gate for prod

 

‚úÖ Achievements

‚Ä¢	Achieved zero-touch deployment to QA environments

‚Ä¢	Simplified tagging and version alignment for config and chart

‚Ä¢	Accelerated feedback on code quality and vulnerabilities

‚Ä¢	Increased reliability and reduced failure rate in deployment
