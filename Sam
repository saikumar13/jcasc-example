Unified View ‚Äî CI/CD in Agile: Why, What, and How

ü§î Is CI/CD a Part of Agile? Or Does DevOps Follow Agile?

‚Ä¢	Agile defines what we deliver and how often ‚Äî DevOps enables how we deliver it

‚Ä¢	CI/CD is a DevOps implementation that makes Agile practical

‚Ä¢	Think of Agile as the strategy, and CI/CD as the execution engine

üéØ CI/CD Objectives:

‚Ä¢	Deliver faster with quality

‚Ä¢	Automate build, test, release

‚Ä¢	Enable continuous feedback and collaboration

üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used:

‚Ä¢	Source: GitHub / GitLab

‚Ä¢	CI: Jenkins, GitHub Actions

‚Ä¢	Quality: SonarQube, TruffleHog

‚Ä¢	Security: BlackDuck

‚Ä¢	Deployment: ArgoCD + Helm + Kubernetes

‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Overview:

‚Ä¢	Automated pipeline with integrated quality/security checks

‚Ä¢	Separate stage to pull env configs and tag with app release

‚Ä¢	Multi-source ArgoCD per environment for GitOps deployments

‚Ä¢	Manual approval for prod deployment

‚úÖ Achievements:

‚Ä¢	Zero-touch deployment to QA after commit

‚Ä¢	Early detection of code quality and security issues

‚Ä¢	Configuration and chart versioning streamlined via CI

‚ö†Ô∏è Drawbacks & Scope for Improvement:

‚Ä¢	Initial complexity in multi-repo orchestration

‚Ä¢	Limited test automation coverage in early phases

‚Ä¢	Opportunity to adopt dynamic environments for PR validation

‚Ä¢	Scope to centralize ArgoCD management via App-of-Apps
